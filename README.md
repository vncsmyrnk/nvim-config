# myconfig.nvim ðŸ’»

This is my local vim/nvim config using lua.

To work properly this repo should be cloned/copied to `~/.config/nvim`.

[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) is used as a plugin manager.

> [!NOTE]
> Neovim versions `0.9` and `0.10` are compatible with this configuration.

## Install

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for the installation.

```bash
just install
```
